**Release Date**: March 10, 2018

* Bump bosh-agent to 2.67.1
	* Agent will now respect previously set permissions and owner on sys/run, sys/log and data job directories
	* This should fix stemcell compatibility with Diego/Garden if Agent restarts
		* If you were using 3541.x stemcell for any of your deployments, it's recommended to update your deployments to this version before updating Director since that would cause Agent restart

#### <a name='critical'></a> USN-3522-2 Addresses Meltdown Vulnerabilities

Meltdown exploits critical vulnerabilities in modern processors.
For more information about Meltdown, see the [Meltdown and Spectre Attacks](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/meltdown-spectre-attacks/) blog post.
[USN-3522-2](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/usn-3522-2/) addresses the critical vulnerability in Ubuntu associated with Meltdown.
</br>
</br>
This update may include degradations to performance if your VM's CPU and memory usage are currently at near-capacity levels.
Prior to upgrading to this stemcell, monitor your PCF VM's current CPU and memory usage and scale those components if necessary. If any of your VMs are currently operating at 60% or above, Pivotal recommends scaling that VM.
For more information about the performance impact of Meltdown-related stemcell patches on PCF components and guidance on scaling, see this [KB article](https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000309953).

[Key Capacity Scaling Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html),
and [Scaling PAS](../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html) topics. Performance degradation is likely to vary by workload type, IaaS, and other factors.
Pivotal recommends testing your deployment thoroughly after upgrading to this stemcell.
