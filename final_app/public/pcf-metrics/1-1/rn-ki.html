        <h2><a id='v1_1_5'></a>Version 1.1.5</h2>

<p><strong>Release Date: November 15, 2016</strong></p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>PCF Metrics 1.1.5 - now with stemcell 3263</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Due to a stemcell upgrade issue in earlier versions of Ops Manager, you must be on Ops Manager 1.7.8 or later to upgrade to PCF Metrics 1.1</li>
<li>Elastic Runtime deployments running on GCP use a HTTPS load balancer that does not support websockets. Several PCF Metrics components require websockets to communicate with each other, such as the SSE connection between the UI and the API. For this reason, PCF Metrics does not currently work on GCP. A future release of PCF Metrics will provide GCP support. </li>
<li>If you do not see logs or metrics in the UI after installation and you use an F5 load balancer, you may be experiencing a proxy issue. For help, see the <a href="/pcf-metrics/1-1/sizing.html#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> section.</li>
<li>If you have access to more than 50 apps, it is possible that you may not be able to see or search for a particular app in apps dropdown. We will fix this issue in the v1.2 release. In the meantime, the following are available workarounds:

<ul>
<li>Click on PCF Metrics link directly from Apps Manager</li>
<li>Copy the appGuid from Apps Manager or from CLI and paste it into the metrics URL </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Due to a known limitation with deep pagination in Elastic Search, if the results of your log query exceed 10k, we are capping the result set that returns to the UI at 10k and disabling the needle navigation interaction. We are working to overcome this issue in the next version of the product. In the meantime, if you are impacted by the 10k result cap on your logs data, you can do the following to ensure more targeted queries:

<ul>
<li>reduce your viewed timeslice to an hour or a minute</li>
<li>use the available search filters</li>
<li>potentially change the timestamp filter from newest to oldest</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On the Explore view, when using the needle navigation interaction on the metrics graphs to jump to a particular point in time of your application logs, you may occasionally see the needle snap to a slightly different time stamp than the time selected. This can occur when there are fewer log lines available for the chosen time and the needle instead snaps to a nearby time. If you experience this issue, we suggest that you scroll within the logs view to the desired time, at which point you should also see the needle move itself to the same time stamp. </li>
<li>For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.</li>
<li>While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>PCF Metrics 1.1.2 - Release bumps required CLI to CLI v6.21.1 and configures CLI environment variable CF_DIAL_TIMEOUT to 30 seconds to reduce chance of CLI errors when network connection attempts include slow DNS resolution times</li>

<h2><a id='v1_1_0'></a>Version 1.1.0</h2>

<p><strong>Release Date: August 1, 2016</strong></p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>PCF Metrics 1.1.0 introduces a new look and a new capability to search and filter up to 24hrs of your application logs. See the <a href="/pcf-metrics/1-1/using.html">Using PCF Metrics</a> topic for more info.

<ul>
<li>With the addition of application logs in PCF Metrics 1.1.X, the product has introduced new Elastic Search Master and Data nodes for logs storage. The additional storage required to support application logs increases the default tile size on installation to approximately 250GB.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>PCF Metrics 1.1.0 uses stemcell 3232</li>
</ul>
